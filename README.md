# A Python3 IRC backdoor
A Proof of Concept (PoC) IRC backdoor written in Python3

First off, don't look at it as a backdoor, look at it as a software to manage your clients from an IRC channel. I know this looks bad but it can actually do some good ;)

I used a "Echo" code for starting the work. Going for pure Python3 with socket rather than using existing IRC clients for Python. I figured this is much more clean and easy to use.


# Future Plan

1) Actually doing the job LOL
2) Adding PGP security to backdoors rather than SSL
